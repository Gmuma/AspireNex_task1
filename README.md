Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python. This game allows two players to play Tic-Tac-Toe on the command line.

Features
-> Two-player mode
-> Command-line interface
-> Basic game logic and checks for win/draw conditions

Getting Started

Prerequisites
 -> Python 3.x installed on your machine

How to Play
-> The game board is a 3x3 grid. Players take turns to place their mark (X or O) on the grid.
-> The game ends when one player gets three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal, or when the board is full and there is no winner (draw).
-> Input your move by specifying the row and column where you want to place your mark.

Acknowledgements
-> Python community for the awesome language and libraries.
-> Inspiration from classic game implementations.
